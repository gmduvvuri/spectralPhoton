spectralPhoton
==============

SpectralPhoton is a Python code intended to enable the rapid ingestion and analysis of photon lists from spectrographs. It was created for use with HST STIS and COS data, but written with extensibility to other instruments in mind. It allows for data from multiple exposures of these data, potentially from different instruments (though this has not been tested), to be combined into single photons lists. These can then be quickly parsed into lightcurves and spectra with sub-exposure time sampling. 

Perhaps one day I will clean up this code and write a nice readme for examples :) For now, however, the code is here to use of draw from for those bold enough to venture forth into a messy code with inconsistent commenting and probably more than a few bugs.
